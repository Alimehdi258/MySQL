# Maven Movie Database MySQL Project

This project focuses on implementing a movie database using MySQL and Maven. The Maven Movie Database contains information about movies, including titles, genres, release years, directors, and actors. The project aims to demonstrate the usage of major SQL clauses and techniques in managing a relational database system.

## Introduction
The Maven Movie Database project provides a practical example of managing a movie database using MySQL and Maven. It demonstrates how to create database tables, insert data, perform queries, and execute various SQL statements using Maven build automation. This project serves as a learning resource for understanding SQL clauses and their usage in real-world database management scenarios.

## Installation
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git`
2. Install MySQL Server on your machine if you haven't already.
3. Ensure you have Maven installed. If not, download and install Maven from the official Apache Maven website.

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository and set up MySQL and Maven, you can use the project as follows:
1. Create a new MySQL database for the Maven Movie Database project.
2. Set up the database connection details in the Maven `pom.xml` file.
3. Use the provided SQL scripts to create the necessary tables and insert sample data into the database.
4. Build the project using Maven: `mvn clean package`
5. Run the SQL queries and statements defined in the project's source files to interact with the database.

## SQL Clauses Covered
The Maven Movie Database project covers various SQL clauses and techniques, including but not limited to:
- `CREATE TABLE`: Creating database tables with specified columns and data types.
- `INSERT INTO`: Inserting data into the database tables.
- `SELECT`: Retrieving data from one or multiple tables using various query options such as filtering, sorting, and joining.
- `UPDATE`: Modifying existing records in the database.
- `DELETE`: Removing records from the database tables.
- `ALTER TABLE`: Modifying the structure of database tables.
- `JOIN`: Combining data from multiple tables based on related columns.
- `GROUP BY`: Grouping data based on specified columns.
- `ORDER BY`: Sorting data in ascending or descending order.
- `WHERE`: Filtering records based on specific conditions.
- `LIMIT`: Limiting the number of records returned by a query.

These clauses and techniques demonstrate fundamental SQL operations for data manipulation and retrieval in the Maven Movie Database project.
